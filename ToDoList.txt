TODO:
- Check c++ version for modules 
- check python Harness
- Comparable<CallSign> ??
- Lamda for c++ 
- use shared_ptr most of the time 
- check if clangtidy work on github action Linter

DONE:
- Main function  ///  Harness.java 
- Random.cpp
- Unique file Benchmark
- Check for a linter

TRY: 
- different memory management (simple *)








WRITTING PART:

First part Description: 
Benchmarking across languages...
    standart approach to translate cpp (my rule, java, sharedptr, vector...)


Second part 
    memory management



    





Monday Call KeyPoint:

- check python for Harness
- CD::Motion Problem with  NULL return. I return shared_ptr actuall to return NULL object
- Create a bool valid and set it to true when initialise it ?
- I use Class{} which is the class with default-initialized member
- Same in List.cpp for Element and TowerDisk
- Instance of itself must be a pointer


TIPS : 

- Check other implementation if I don't know what to do/choose (if witch case...)


- std::any type safe, if cast to the wrong type throw an exception 
- Void* get undefined behavior, hard to find were is the bug
