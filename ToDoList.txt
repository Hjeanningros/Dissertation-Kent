TODO:
- Check c++ version for modules 
- check python Harness
- Lamda for c++ 
- use shared_ptr most of the time 
- check if clangtidy work on github action Linter

DONE:
- richards

TRY: 
- different memory management (simple *)
- If I have more time, can compare energie of different languages


CALL MONDAY:
- .fill (Scheduler) I use for loop
- I had conversation about low level language, more eco friendly


RICHARDS DEBUG:
- std::make_shared<...>(args) instead of this;




WRITTING PART:

First part Description: 
Benchmarking across languages...
    standart approach to translate cpp (my rule, java, sharedptr, vector...)


Second part 
    memory management



    





Monday Call KeyPoint:

- check python for Harness


TIPS : 

- Check other implementation if I don't know what to do/choose (if witch case...)


- std::any type safe, if cast to the wrong type throw an exception 
- Void* get undefined behavior, hard to find were is the bug
